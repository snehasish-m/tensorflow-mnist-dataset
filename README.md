# tensorflow-mnist-dataset
Training the neural network with MNIST image dataset for digit recognition.

The neural network has 3 hidden layers of 500 nodes each 
and an output layer of 10 nodes (one for each digit).

Accuracy achieved was ~95%.

A few manipulations in the number of nodes may increase the accuracy slightly
or may even reduce it.

This is simply an implementation of Deep Neural Network on the
MNIST dataset.
